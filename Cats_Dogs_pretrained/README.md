Usage:
```bash
python cats_dogs_pretrained.py /home/lopes/Datasets/dogs-vs-cats ./smaller 

```

In fact, I meet a lot of trouble while using the ICS machine, the former assignment server give me a TitanX GPU and since the assignment recommand me use python3.6, i use the cuda 11.7;

But in this assignment server give me a RTX 4000, which only use cuda 12.x

so i have to update my env ,and that cost me lots of time.
